# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews

This project delves into the realm of sentiment analysis, exploring the opinions and emotions expressed in Amazon product reviews. The project employs a comprehensive approach, combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and machine learning algorithms to extract and analyze sentiment from customer reviews.

# Key Highlights:

Quick EDA: Gain insights into the distribution of review ratings and sentiment patterns using basic data visualization techniques.

BASIC NLTK: Utilize the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to perform text preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

VADER SENTIMENT SCORING: Employ the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis tool to assess the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of customer reviews.

Plot VADER results: Visualize the distribution of VADER sentiment scores to gain a broader understanding of overall sentiment trends.

Roberta Pretrained Model: Employ the Roberta pretrained model, a powerful language model from Google AI, to perform sentiment classification on customer reviews.

Compare Scores Between Models: Compare the sentiment scores obtained from VADER and Roberta to evaluate the effectiveness of each approach.

Review Examples: Explore specific review examples to illustrate the application of sentiment analysis techniques and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying sentiment expressed in customer reviews.



This project provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding sentiment analysis and its application to Amazon product reviews.
